# Edit-first loop

When I run this command, do the following:

1. Read the files I mention and any obvious related tests.
2. Summarize current behavior in 3–5 sentences.
3. Propose a small, concrete plan (1–3 steps).
4. Show a minimal diff for the change instead of full files.
5. Suggest an update line for progress.md, including date, file(s), and purpose.
